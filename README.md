# Assorted Problems on DSA 
Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of the subject and to curate a list of problems based on my best understanding. 

### Contents
The contents are recursively listed in [ls-R](./ls-R.txt) file

### Running an Algorithm implementation 
Assuming the repo is locally cloned, 
1. Install g++ (one time)
  Debian: 
  ```
  sudo apt install g++
  ```
2. Run the file
```
  g++ -o a PROBLEM.cpp
  ./a
```

#### Contribution 
This repository is contribution friendly! If you'd like to add or improve an algorithm, your contribution is welcome! Send me a pull request to review
