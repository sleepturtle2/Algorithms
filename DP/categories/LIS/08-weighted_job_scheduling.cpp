/*Given N jobs where every job is represented by following three elements of it.
1. Start Time
2. Finish Time
3. Profit or Value Associated
Find the maximum profit subset of jobs such that no two jobs in the subset overlap.

We first need to sort jobs according to start time. Let job[0..n-1] be the array of jobs after sorting. We define vector L such that L[i] is itself is a vector that stores Weighted Job Scheduling of job[0..i] that ends with job[i]. Therefore for an index i, L[i] can be recursively written as â€“

L[0] = {job[0]}
L[i] = {MaxSum(L[j])} + job[i] where j < i and job[j].finish <= job[i].start
     = job[i], if there is no such j
